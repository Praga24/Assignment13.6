1. What kind of data Hbase can store.
Hbase can manage structured and semi or even unstructured data.


2. Explain the important terms in hbase architecture.
The important terms in HBase architecture are:
*Region servers serve data for reads and writes.
*Regions are assigned to the Regoin Servers.A region server can serve about 1,000 regions.
*HBase Master process handles the Region assignment, DDL (create, delete tables) operations.
*Zookeeper maintains a live cluster state.
*The Hadoop DataNode stores the data that the Region Server is managing.
*The NameNode maintains metadata information for all the physical data blocks.


3. What is zookeeper? What happens if the zookeeper service is stopped.
HBase uses ZooKeeper as a distributed coordination service to maintain server state in the cluster.
Zookeeper maintains which servers are alive and available, and provides server failure notification. 
If Zookeeper service is stopped HBase may go down as it relies on Zookeeper.


4. Is it necessary that region server be located on all DataNodes?
Yes.For best performance and functioning, it is necessary.


5. How will you implement joins in Hbase?
 The techniques to implement joins in Hbase are:
*Denormalizing the data and write into HBase
*Loading the HBase tables into hive and perform joins or write Mapreduce code.
